  <li><b>30 June 2006 -- BusyBox 1.2.0</b>
    <p>The -devel branch has been stabilized and the result is
    <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.2.0.tar.bz2">Busybox
    1.2.0</a>.  Lots of stuff changed, I need to work up a decent changelog
    over the weekend.</p>

    <p>I'm still experimenting with how long is best for the development
    cycle, and since we've got some largeish projects queued up I'm going to
    try a longer one.  Expect 1.3.0 in December.  (Expect 1.2.1 any time
    we fix enough bugs. :)</p>

  <li><b>17 May 2006 -- BusyBox 1.1.3 (stable)</b>
    <p><a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.3.tar.bz2">BusyBox
    1.1.3</a> is another bugfix release.  It makes passwd use salt, fixes a
    memory freeing bug in ls, fixes "build all sources at once" mode, makes
    mount -a not abort on the first failure, fixes msh so ctrl-c doesn't kill
    background processes, makes patch work with patch hunks that don't have a
    timestamp, make less's text search a lot more robust (the old one could
    segfault), and fixes readlink -f when built against uClibc.</p>

    <p>Expect 1.2.0 sometime next month, which won't be a bugfix release.</p>

  <li><b>10 April 2006 -- BusyBox 1.1.2 (stable)</b>
    <p>You can now download <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.2.tar.bz2">BusyBox 1.1.2</a>, a bug fix release consisting of 11 patches
    backported from the development branch: Some build fixes, several fixes
    for mount and nfsmount, a fix for insmod on big endian systems, a fix for
    find -xdev, and a fix for comm.  Check the file "changelog" in the tarball
    for more info.</p>

    <p>The next new development release (1.2.0) is slated for June.  A 1.1.3
    will be released before then if more bug fixes crop up.  (The new plan is
    to have a 1.x.0 new development release every 3 months, with 1.x.y stable
    bugfix only releases based on that as appropriate.)</p>
    
  <li><b>27 March 2006 -- Software Freedom Law Center representing BusyBox and uClibc</b>
    <p>One issue Erik Andersen wanted to resolve when handing off BusyBox
    maintainership to Rob Landley was license enforcement.  BusyBox and
    uClibc's existing license enforcement efforts (pro-bono representation
    by Erik's father's law firm, and the
    <a href="http://www.busybox.net/shame.html">Hall of Shame</a>), haven't
    scaled to match the popularity of the projects.  So we put our heads
    together and did the obvious thing: ask Pamela Jones of
    <a href="http://www.groklaw.net">Groklaw</a> for suggestions.  She
    referred us to the fine folks at softwarefreedom.org.</p>

    <p>As a result, we're pleased to announce that the
    <a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org">Software Freedom Law Center</a>
    has agreed to represent BusyBox and uClibc.  We join a number of other
    free and open source software projects (such as
    <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/141806/">X.org</a>,
    <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/135413/">Wine</a>, and
    <a href="http://plone.org/foundation/newsitems/software-freedom-law-center-support/">Plone</a>
    in being represented by a fairly cool bunch of lawyers, which is not a
    phrase you get to use every day.</p>

  <li><b>22 March 2006 -- BusyBox 1.1.1</b>
    <p>The new maintainer is Rob Landley, and the new release is <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.1.tar.bz2">BusyBox 1.1.1</a>.  Expect a "what's new" document in a few days.  (Also, Erik and I have have another announcement pending...)</p>
    <p>Update: Rather than put out an endless stream of 1.1.1.x releases,
    the various small fixes have been collected together into a
    <a href="http://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.1.fixes.patch">patch</a>,
    and new fixes will be appended to that as needed.  Expect 1.1.2 around
    June.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>11 January 2006 -- 1.1.0 is out</b>
    <p>The new stable release is
    <a href="http://www.busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.1.0.tar.bz2">BusyBox
    1.1.0</a>.  It has a number of improvements, including several new applets.
    (It also has <a href="http://www.busybox.net/lists/busybox/2006-January/017733.html">a few rough spots</a>,
    but we're trying out a "release early, release often" strategy to see how
    that works.  Expect 1.1.1 sometime in March.)</p>
